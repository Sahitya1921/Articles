# Artificial Intelligence 

Artificial Intelligence is the encouragement of human brain intelligence in a machine body or device. This system can process learning, thinking logically, and self-correction. This gives a diverse scope to typically performed tasks that require human intelligence. 

## Basic AI Terminologies 

**Machine learning:**

It is a section of AI that allows the system to learn from data without being distinctively programmed. It focuses mainly on algorithms that help to perform according to data-based prediction and improvement. For example - robots perform calculations according to data fed to them.

**Neural network:** 

This system is inspired by the function and structure of the human brain. Talking about the structure of the brain, there are neurons present, which can be seen an interconnected nodes that help in interacting with data.

**Supervised learning:** 

Machine learning where we input some labeled data. According to that, the device responds to the given output.

**Unsupervised learning:** 

In contrast to supervised learning, here the data is unmarked and the device tries to find the hidden patterns and combinations without direct guidance.

**Computer vision:** 

Developers have tried to design it in a way so it can recognise and elucidate visual information from the real world.

**Reinforcement learning:** 

This type of learning helps in interacting with the surroundings and behaving according to them, and the device receives punishment and rewards according to the performance.

**Natural language processing:** 

It is one of the branches that helps devices understand and interpret human language in a meaningful way and with appropriate language.

## Overview of AI Applications Across Various Industries

**Entertainment:**

One of the features that help content creators form videos with the help of content creation tools, visual effects, and analytics. And for those who live playing games, AI provides an auto-generated opponent in some games.

**In Education:**

Education is one of the areas where AI has made a major difference by providing personalized learning. Providing a platform for doubt-solving in seconds without any hesitation.

**Healthcare:**

By providing improved accuracy in diagnostics, managing data that saves time, and helping doctors in their decision-making for the best treatment.

**Financial services:**

It is helping by providing great efficiency in financial analysis and services like data entry, customer service, etc. Making it easier to manage most of the services.

**AI in manufacturing robotics:**

It has created a vast change in the world of robotics by optimizing errors and increasing productivity.

**AI in cybersecurity:**

Whenever cybercrime happens, cyber security is one of the methods to get information about the crime. Handling data, entering this sector has gradually emerged as one of the best tools.

## *There are several methods for evaluating the performance of AI systems:*

•Accuracy

•F1 Score

•Mean Square Error

•Confusion matrix

•Mean Absolute Error

•Interpretability

•Bias and fairness

•Cross- Validation

•Precision and recall

•ROC curve and AUC

•The evaluation can be done with the above-given methods according to the type of AI and the specific tasks that need to be done by it.

### Ways to use AI in our homes

 ***Smart home assistant:*** 

This is one of the smartest uses of AI, just like Amazon Echo is one of them. We can command them; otherwise, they function on their own.

***Energy reduction:***

By optimizing the use of energy according to our present and absence and with respect to how much we use. Just like a smart light system and a heating and cooling system.

***Security Aspects:*** 

Here, it can be used in security cameras for detection of any unobvious activity and sending an alert to our devices.

***Home cleaning robots:*** 

There are a number of robots that are designed to work for this. By measuring the area, they keep it clean, just like a robotic mop.

***Environmental Monitoring:*** 
Controlling the humidity and temperatures according to the atmosphere. One of the best-used ones is an air purifier used in cities where pollution is high.

#### *This is all about artificial intelligence. This technology has a lot more to discuss, but for now, we end this here and hope for more such development in the technological world.*
