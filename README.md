# API

## Introduction

An API (Application Programming Interface) defines how software components should be interacted. It can be seen as a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications. Mainly, it works as an intermediate that provides a platform for applications to talk to each other.

## How API functions

Its main function is defined by setting rules, protocols, and tools for building applications and software. Given below is the simplified breakdown of how the API works.



**Request**- Request sent by application to set down the actions it wants to perform or the data it wants to access.



**Processing**- The API receives the request and the process the further needed action according to the rules and protocols. 



**Authentication and Authorization**- To ensure security, API checks the identity and permissions of the requesting application or body.



**Execution**- Now API performs the task that is requested, either certain action or any service .



**Response**- Once the action is completed, API sends a response back to the requesting application, in a data format such as JSON or XTML.



**Handling errors**- Sometimes errors occur, and during this time the API returns an appropriate code or message to the requesting body. 



## Architecture of API:



Architecture of an API is based on varius design principles and patterns. The most commonly used architectural styles for API include:



* REST (Representational state transfer): This relies on a stateless client-server communication model.



* Microservices: Microservices architecture decomposes applications into small independent services 



* SOAP (Simple object access protocol): it is a protocol-based architectural style for building distributed systems. 



* GraphQL: GraphQL is a open-source data query and manipulation language.



* RPC (Remote procedure call): This enables communication between distributed systems by invoking distributed systems, by invoking procedures or methods on remote servers. 



* Event-Driven Architecture: This defines event schemes and messaging protocols for publishing and subscribing to events.



## API for different systems 



**Web API**



**Operating system API** 



**Database API** 



**Cloud API**



**Hardware API**



**Messaging API**  



## API has numerous advantages:



### Flexibility

API creates a system where systems can communicate, interact and enables flexibility in building and integrating applications. 



### Modularity

Provide modularity by creating simpler and manageable components that can be updated, developed and maintained separately.



### Improved user experience 

As API provides access to diverse data sources and services, using the user experience expands.



### Ecosystem Growth

API fosters the growth of ecosystem, attracting developers, partners, and users. This can drive innovation and adoption.



## As an advantage, it also has disadvantages:



### Dependency 

Most applications rely on API and by any chances or circumstances if the provider stop its functionality, leading to the potential downtime.



### Security risk 

Can introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly secured, data can be at a high risk.



### complexity 

Multiple API from different operators create complexity.



**Many more advantages and disadvantages can be seen, but what we conclude is the API is one of the creations which has created a huge effect in this technical world which is appreciated.**
