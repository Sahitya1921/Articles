# API
## Introduction
An API (Application Programming Interface) defines how software compnents should intracct. It can be seen as a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications. Mainly it works as intermeidate that provide a platform to applications to talk to each other .
## How API functions
Its main function is defined by setting rules, protocols, and tools for building applications and softwares. Given below is the simplified breakdown of how APIs work:

**Request**- Request send by application to set down the actions it wants to perform or the data it want to access.

**Processing**- The API receives the request and the process the further needed action according to the rules and protocols. 

**Authentication and Authorisation**- To ensure security, API checks the identity and permissions the requesting application or body.

**Execution**- Now API performs the task that is requested either certain action or any service .

**Response**- Once the action is completed, API sends a response back to the requesting application, in a data format such as JSON or XTML.

**Handling errors**- Sometimes errors occur, and during this time API return an appropriate code or message to the requesting body. 

## Architcture of API:

Architeccture of an API is based on varius design principles and patterns. Most commonly used arcitectural styles for APIs include:

* REST (Representational state transfer): This relies on stateless client-server communication model.

* Microservices: Microservices architecture decomposes applications into small indipendent services 

* SOAP (Simple object access protocol):Is protocol-based architectural style for building distributed systems. 

* GraphQL:GraphQL is a open-source data query and manipulation language .

* RPC(Remote procedure call): This enables communication between distributed systems by invoking distributed systems by invoking procrdures and or methods on remote servers. 

* Event-Driven Architecture: This define event schemes and messaging protocols for publishing and subscribing to events.

## API for different systems 

**Web API**

**Operating system APIs** 

**Database APIs** 

**Cloud APIs**

**Hardware APIs**

**Messaging APIs**  

## API has numerous advantages:

### Flexibility
API creates a system where systems can communicate, interact and enables flexibility in building and integrating applications. 

### Modularity
Provide modularity by by creating simpler and manageable components that can be updated, developed and maintained separatly.

### Improved user experience 
As API provide access to use diverse data sources and services user excperience expands.

### Ecosysytem Growth
API foster the growth of ecosystem, attaracting developers, partners, and users, this can drive innovation and adoption.

## As advantage it also have disadvantages:

### Dependency 
Most application rely on API and by any chances or circumstances if the provider stop its functionality, leading to the potential downtime.

### Security risk 
can introduce security vulnerabilies if not properly secured, data can be at a high risk.

### complexity 
Multiple APIs from differnt operators create complexity.

**Many more advantages and disadvantages can be seen but what we conclude is API is one of the creation which has created a huge effect in this technical world which is appreciated.**
